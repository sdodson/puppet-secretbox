module Puppet::Parser::Functions
  newfunction(:secretbox, :type => :rvalue, :doc => <<-eodoc) do |args|
Requires an index be passed as the first parameter. This index, along with the
node's FQDN will be used to uniquely identify a secret. If the secret doesn't
exist prior to the call, it will be generated. In this instance, secretbox can
accept a second argument, which specifies the length of the randomly generated
value. If the second value is left unspecified, it defaults to 32 characters
long.

The generated value can contain any printable ASCII value (character codes 32
through 126), excluding single quote ('), double quotes ("), forward slash (/)
and hash (#).

Upon generation, the value is saved to a file named the passed index. The file
is stored in a directory named after the FQDN. This directory is then stored
within the 'secretbox' directory, underneath Puppet's 'vardir'. In practice,
a given index has it's value stored in `/var/lib/puppet/secretbox/FQDN/index`.
